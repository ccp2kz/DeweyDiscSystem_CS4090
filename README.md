# Dewey Disc System

## Project Overview
The **Dewey Disc System** is an intelligent disc golf assistant designed to help players of all skill levels improve their performance. The app allows users to create accounts, build and manage virtual disc bags, and receive smart recommendations based on real-time course data, wind conditions, and player skill level. It also includes visual shot shape displays and course mapping tools for better strategic play.

## Team Information
**Team Name:** Team Dewey  
**Team Members and Roles:**
- Cody Peters — Team Lead / Developer  
- Rohith — Developer  
- Documentation — Documentation Lead  

## Objectives
- Enable secure user registration and login for data persistence.  
- Allow players to search for and add discs to a virtual bag.  
- Generate single and multiple disc recommendations based on course and weather conditions.  
- Visualize flight paths and distances using hole layout and wind data.  
- Provide course selection and mapping capabilities for easy navigation.

## Core Features (Use Case Highlights)
1. **Create Account (UC1):** User creates a new account with email and password.  
2. **Secure Login (UC19):** Protects user data via authentication and session management.  
3. **Add Disc to Virtual Bag (UC2):** Search for discs and add them to a virtual collection.  
4. **View Simple Disc Recommendation (UC3):** Suggests the best disc for a given hole.  
5. **Select Course from List (UC4):** Displays nearby or saved courses for the player.  
6. **View Weather Conditions (UC8):** Retrieves and shows live weather data.  
7. **Calculate Shot Distance (UC10):** Uses GPS to measure distance to the target pin.  
8. **Multiple Disc Recommendations (UC9):** Provides conservative, moderate, and aggressive shot options.  
9. **Account for Wind in Recommendations (UC12):** Adjusts disc suggestions based on wind speed and direction.  
10. **View Shot Shape Visualization (UC11):** Overlays a visual flight path on the hole map.

## Branching Policy
- **main** – Stable branch for tested, production-ready code.  
- **development** – Active development branch for new features and testing.  
- **feature branches** – Short-lived branches for individual features.  

**Rules:**
1. All work begins on a feature branch based on `development`.  
2. Completed features are merged into `development` after review.  
3. At the end of each sprint, `development` merges into `main` for release.
